## Usage

Add this to your `init.lua`

```lua
-- You can configure your bookmarks using simplified syntax
local bookmarks = {
  { tag = "Desktop", path = "~/Desktop", key = "d" },
  { tag = "Documents", path = "~/Documents", key = "D" },
  { tag = "Downloads", path = "~/Downloads", key = "o" },
}

-- You can also configure bookmarks with key arrays
local bookmarks = {
  { tag = "Desktop", path = "~/Desktop", key = { "d", "D" } },
  { tag = "Documents", path = "~/Documents", key = { "d", "d" } },
  { tag = "Downloads", path = "~/Downloads", key = "o" },
}

-- Windows-specific bookmarks
if ya.target_family() == "windows" then
  local home_path = os.getenv("USERPROFILE")
  table.insert(bookmarks, {
    tag = "Scoop Local",
    path = os.getenv("SCOOP") or (home_path .. "\\scoop"),
    key = "p"
  })
  table.insert(bookmarks, {
    tag = "Scoop Global",
    path = os.getenv("SCOOP_GLOBAL") or "C:\\ProgramData\\scoop",
    key = "P"
  })
end

require("whoosh"):setup {
  -- Configuration bookmarks (cannot be deleted through plugin)
  bookmarks = bookmarks,

  -- Notification settings
  jump_notify = false,

  -- Key generation for auto-assigning bookmark keys
  keys = "0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",

  -- File path for storing user bookmarks
  path = (ya.target_family() == "windows" and os.getenv("APPDATA") .. "\\yazi\\config\\bookmark") or
         (os.getenv("HOME") .. "/.config/yazi/bookmark"),

  -- Path truncation in navigation menu
  path_truncate_enabled = false,                        -- Enable/disable path truncation
  path_max_depth = 3,                                   -- Maximum path depth before truncation

  -- Path truncation in fuzzy search (fzf)
  fzf_path_truncate_enabled = false,                    -- Enable/disable path truncation in fzf
  fzf_path_max_depth = 5,                               -- Maximum path depth before truncation in fzf

  -- Long folder name truncation
  path_truncate_long_names_enabled = false,             -- Enable in navigation menu
  fzf_path_truncate_long_names_enabled = false,         -- Enable in fzf
  path_max_folder_name_length = 20,                     -- Max length in navigation menu
  fzf_path_max_folder_name_length = 20,                 -- Max length in fzf

  -- History directory settings
  history_size = 10,                                    -- Number of directories in history (default 10)
  history_fzf_path_truncate_enabled = false,            -- Enable/disable path truncation by depth for history
  history_fzf_path_max_depth = 5,                       -- Maximum path depth before truncation for history (default 5)
  history_fzf_path_truncate_long_names_enabled = false, -- Enable/disable long folder name truncation for history
  history_fzf_path_max_folder_name_length = 30,         -- Maximum length for folder names in history (default 30)
}
```

Add this to your `keymap.toml`:

```toml
[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]
on = "["
run = "plugin whoosh jump_by_key"
desc = "Jump bookmark by key"

# Direct fuzzy search access
[[mgr.prepend_keymap]]
on = "}"

```

## Features

### Temporary Bookmarks

Session-only bookmarks that don't persist between Yazi restarts:

- Create using `save_temp` or `save_cwd_temp` commands
- Identified with [TEMP] prefix in navigation menu and fzf
- Automatically cleared when Yazi restarts
- Can be deleted individually or all at once with `delete_all_temp`

### Directory History

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="image/history.png" alt="History preview" width="1100px">
</div>

The plugin supports a smart directory history system:

- **Independent history per tab** - Each tab maintains its own history
- **Automatic tracking** - History updates when navigating between directories
- **Current directory filtering** - Current directory is excluded from history display
- **Configurable size** - Number of stored directories is configurable (default 10)
- **Separate truncation settings** - Independent path display settings for history

**System behavior:**

- History is empty on first yazi startup
- Previous directories are added to history only when navigating to a new directory
- New items are added to the beginning of the list (sorted from newest to oldest)
- When limit is exceeded, oldest items are removed
- Duplicates are automatically removed and moved to the top

### Navigation Menu Features

When using `jump_by_key`, you get access to a smart navigation menu with:

- **Create temporary bookmark** - Press `<Enter>` to quickly bookmark current directory
- **Fuzzy search** - Press `<Space>` to open fzf search
- **Directory history** - Press `<Tab>` to browse history via fzf (only if history exists)
- **Previous directory** - Press `<Backspace>` to return to the previous directory (if available)
- **All bookmarks** - Both permanent and temporary bookmarks with clear visual distinction

### Directory History Navigation

The plugin provides two ways to navigate history:

1. **Through navigation menu** - When using `jump_by_key`, press `<Tab>` to access history
2. **Direct access** - Use the `history` command or Tab key binding for direct fzf access to history

### Bookmark Types

The plugin supports three types of bookmarks:

1. **Configuration bookmarks** - Defined in `init.lua`, cannot be deleted through the plugin
2. **User bookmarks** - Created during usage, saved to file, can be deleted
3. **Temporary bookmarks** - Session-only, stored in memory, cleared on restart

When paths conflict, user bookmarks override configuration bookmarks in the display

## Configuration Options

The plugin supports the following configuration options in the `setup()` function:

| Option                                 | Type    | Default                 | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `history_fzf_path_max_folder_name_length` | number | `30`                   | Maximum folder name length before truncation for Tab history       |

**Note:** Configuration bookmarks defined in the `bookmarks` option cannot be deleted through the plugin interface. They serve as permanent, protected bookmarks that are always available

### Bookmark Configuration

The plugin supports a simplified bookmark syntax in the configuration:

```lua
-- Simplified syntax (recommended)
local bookmarks = {
  { tag = "Desktop", path = "~/Desktop", key = "d" },
  { tag = "Projects", path = "~/Projects", key = "p" },
}
```

**Features of simplified syntax:**

- **Tilde expansion** - `~` is automatically expanded to home directory
- **Path normalization** - Separators `/` are automatically converted for your OS
- **Automatic trailing separator** - Directories get proper trailing separators

### Path Truncation

The path truncation feature can be controlled by two options:

- `path_truncate_enabled` (boolean, default: `false`) - Enables or disables path truncation entirely. If not specified in config, defaults to `false`
- `path_max_depth` (number, default: `3`) - Controls how long paths are displayed in the navigation menu

When `path_truncate_enabled` is explicitly set to `true` and a path has more directory levels than `path_max_depth`, the beginning parts are replaced with "â€¦" to keep the display concise.

**By default (when `path_truncate_enabled` is not specified or set to `false`):**

- All paths are displayed in full without truncation
- `C:\Users\Documents\Projects\MyProject` â†’ `C:\Users\Documents\Projects\MyProject` (full path)

**With `path_truncate_enabled = true` and `path_max_depth = 3`:**

- `C:\Users\Documents` â†’ `C:\Users\Documents` (no change, 3 parts)
- `C:\Users\Documents\Projects\MyProject` â†’ `C:\â€¦\Projects\MyProject` (truncated, 5 parts)
- `~/.config/yazi/plugins/whoosh.yazi` â†’ `~\â€¦\plugins\whoosh.yazi` (truncated, 5 parts)

#### Folder Name Length Truncation

Long folder names can be truncated to improve readability in both navigation menu and fuzzy search:

**Configuration Options:**

- `path_truncate_long_names_enabled` (boolean, default: `false`) - Enable/disable for navigation menu
- `fzf_path_truncate_long_names_enabled` (boolean, default: `false`) - Enable/disable for fuzzy search (fzf)
- `path_max_folder_name_length` (number, default: `20`) - Maximum length for folder names in navigation menu
- `fzf_path_max_folder_name_length` (number, default: `20`) - Maximum length for folder names in fuzzy search

**How it works:**

- Individual folder names longer than the specified limit are truncated to 40% of the limit + "..."
- This truncation is applied to each folder name separately and works independently of depth-based path truncation
- Both truncation methods can be used together for optimal display
- Windows drive letters (e.g., `C:\`) are handled specially and never truncated

**Examples with `path_max_folder_name_length = 20`:**

- `VeryLongFolderNameThatExceedsLimit` â†’ `VeryLongFâ€¦` (9 chars + "â€¦")
- `C:\VeryLongFolderNameThatExceedsLimit\Documents` â†’ `C:\VeryLongFâ€¦\Documents`
- `ShortName` â†’ `ShortName` (no change, under limit)
- `/home/VeryLongFolderNameThatExceedsLimit/projects` â†’ `/home/VeryLongFâ€¦/projects`

**Combined with depth truncation:**

When both folder name truncation and depth-based truncation are enabled, folder names are shortened first, then depth truncation is applied:

- Original: `C:\Users\VeryLongFolderNameThatExceedsLimit\Documents\Projects\MyProject`
- After folder name truncation: `C:\Users\VeryLongFâ€¦\Documents\Projects\MyProject`
- After depth truncation (max_depth=3): `C:\â€¦\Projects\MyProject`

This feature significantly improves readability in deeply nested directory structures while preserving the most relevant path information.
